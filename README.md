# Fish UI

[Live Site](http://fish.stevenskelton.ca/)

User interface for an aquarium purchase manager, written using Polymer Web Components.
Because of this, it targets "evergreen" browsers.

## Polymer Setup

Expects [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org) 0.1.3 to be in **/components** directory.
This means everything: the *platform* polyfills, *core*, as well as the *polymer-elements* and 
*polymer-ui-elements*.

I followed the [git instructions](http://www.polymer-project.org/getting-the-code.html#git).
